## Delay and Reverb VST Plug-in for your favorite DAW.

#### Prerequities
This plugin uses local presets that are normally present in these directories depending on your OS: 

- On Linux:   ~/.config/CanyonTeam/Deeeeee_v_x_x/Presets/
- On MacOS:   ~/Library/CanyonTeam/Deeeeee_v_x_x//Presets/
- On Windows: \Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\CanyonTeam\Deeeeee_v_x_x\Presets

Once the plugin went through first run, it should have created the various folders
constituting the preset path on your system (unless it doesn't own the rights to).

Therefore, you must place, after first run, the content of the *Resources* folder
inside the corresponding Presets folder of your OS.
